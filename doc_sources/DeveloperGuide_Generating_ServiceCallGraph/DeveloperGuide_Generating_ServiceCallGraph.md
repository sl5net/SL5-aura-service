# Developer Guide: Generating the Service Call Graph

This document describes the robust, thread-safe method for generating a visual Call Graph of the long-running `dictation_service.py`. We use the `yappi` profiler (for multi-threading support) and `gprof2dot` for visualization.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed globally or in your virtual environment:

```bash
# Required Python libraries for profiling
pip install yappi gprof2dot

# Required system library for visualization
# Linux: sudo apt install graphviz 
```

### Step 1: Modifying the Service for Profiling

The `dictation_service.py` script must be modified to manually start the `yappi` profiler and gracefully save the profiling data upon interruption (`Ctrl+C`).

**Key Changes in `dictation_service.py`:**

1.  **Imports and Signal Handler:** Import `yappi` and define the `generate_graph_on_interrupt` function (as implemented previously) to call `yappi.stop()` and `stats.save(...)`.
2.  **Start/Stop:** Add `yappi.start()` and `signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, ...)` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to wrap the execution of `main(...)`.

### Step 2: Running the Service and Collecting Data

Run the modified script directly and allow it to process data for a sufficient time (e.g., 10-20 seconds) to ensure all core functions, including threaded ones (like LanguageTool correction), are called.

```bash
# Execute the service directly (do NOT use the pycallgraph wrapper)
python3 dictation_service.py
```

Press **Ctrl+C** once to trigger the signal handler. This will stop the profiler and save the raw data to:

`\mathbf{yappi\_profile\_data.prof`

### Step 3: Generating and Filtering the Visual Graph

We use `gprof2dot` to convert the raw `pstats` data into the SVG format. Since advanced filtering options like `--include` and `--threshold` may not be supported by our specific environment, we use the basic **`--strip`** filter to clean up path information and reduce clutter from system internals.

**Execute the visualization command:**

```bash
python3 -m gprof2dot -f pstats yappi_profile_data.prof --strip | dot -Tsvg -o yappi_call_graph_stripped.svg
```

### Step 4: Documentation (Manual Crop)

The resulting `yappi_call_graph_stripped.svg` (or `.png`) file will be large, but it accurately contains the full execution flow, including all threads.

For documentation purposes, **manually crop the image** to focus on the central logic (the 10-20 core nodes and their connections) to create a focused and readable Call Graph for the repository documentation.

### Archiving

The modified configuration file and the final Call Graph visualization should be archived in the documentation source directory:

| Artifact | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Modified Service File** | `doc_sources/profiling/dictation_service_profiling_base.py` |
| **Final Cropped Image** | `doc_sources/profiling/core_logic_call_graph.svg` |
| **Raw Profiling Data** | *(Optional: Should be excluded from final repository documentation)* |
