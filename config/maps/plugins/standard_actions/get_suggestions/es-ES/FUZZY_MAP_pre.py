# This map uses a hybrid approach:

# 1. Regex entries are checked first. They are powerful and can be case-insensitive.

# Structure: ('replacement', r'regex_pattern', threshold, flags)

# - The threshold is ignored for regex.

# - flags: Use {'command_flags': re.IGNORECASE} for case-insensitivity, or 0 for case-sensitivity.

# 2. If no regex matches, a simple fuzzy match is performed on the remaining rules.


FUZZY_MAP_pre = [
    # === General Terms (Case-Insensitive) ===
    # Using word boundaries (\b) and grouping (|) to catch variations efficiently.

    # Importing to know:

    # - it stops with first full-match. Examples: ^...$ = Full Match = Stop Criterion!

    # - first is read first imported, lower rules maybe not get read.
