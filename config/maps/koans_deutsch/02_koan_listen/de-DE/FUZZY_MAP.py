# This map uses a hybrid approach:
# 1. Regex entries are checked first. They are powerful and can be case-insensitive.
#    Structure: ('replacement', r'regex_pattern', threshold, flags)
#    - The threshold is ignored for regex.
#    - flags: Use {'flags': re.IGNORECASE} for case-insensitivity, or 0 for case-sensitivity.
# 2. If no regex matches, a simple fuzzy match is performed on the remaining rules.

FUZZY_MAP = [
    # === General Terms (Case-Insensitive) ===
    # Using word boundaries (\b) and grouping (|) to catch variations efficiently.
    # Importing to know:
    # - it stops with first full-match. Examples: ^...$ = Full Match = Stop Criterion! 
    # - means first is most importend, lower rules maybe not get read.
