### **STT Project - Manjaro Setup Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 4, 2025

**Environment:**
-   **Distribution:** Manjaro Linux with KDE Plasma
-   **ISO Used:** `manjaro-kde-25.0.4-minimal-250623-linux612.iso`
-   **Platform:** Running as a guest in VirtualBox.

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

**Summary:**

The significantly improved `manjaro_arch_setup.sh` was tested on both a fresh Manjaro VM and an existing installation. The script is now fully automated, robust, and user-friendly, successfully setting up the entire application for end-to-end transcription in both scenarios.

**Key Findings:**

-   **Intelligent Dependency Handling:** The script correctly identifies a pre-existing, compatible Java installation (version >=17) and skips the setup, preventing conflicts.
-   **Idempotency:** The script runs successfully on a system where the application is already installed, without causing errors.
-   **Location-Independent:** The script can be executed from any directory and still correctly locates the project root.
-   **End-to-End Functionality:** The setup process, from dependency installation to model download, completes successfully, resulting in a fully working application.
