### **STT Project - Manjaro Setup Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 3, 2025

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Manjaro Linux with KDE Plasma
- **ISO Used:** `manjaro-kde-25.0.4-minimal-250623-linux612.iso`
- **Platform:** Running as a guest in VirtualBox.

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

**Summary:**

The setup process for the STT application was tested on a fresh Manjaro Linux virtual machine and confirmed to be fully functional.

The `manjaro_arch_setup.sh` script successfully installed all required system dependencies (from `pacman`) and Python packages. All external models and tools were downloaded and configured correctly. The application starts, loads the models, and performs end-to-end audio transcription as expected.

**Key Findings:**

-   The system successfully records audio, transcribes it, and outputs the resulting text via `xdotool`.
-   The test was completed using only the project's provided scripts.
-   No external macro utilities (e.g., `autokey`) were required for functionality.
