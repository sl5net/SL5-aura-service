### **STT Project - Windows 11 Application Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 6, 2025

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Windows 11 Pro
- **Platform:** Running in VirtualBox

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS (Manual Script Start Required)**

**Summary:**

This test confirms that all issues identified in the previous report (`...0705.md`) have been successfully resolved. The `windows11_setup.ps1` installer now correctly installs all Python dependencies. 

Furthermore, a platform-aware notification system for Windows has been implemented using a dedicated `notification_watcher.ahk` script, providing essential user feedback. The core application is now **fully functional end-to-end** on Windows.

**Identified Issue & Root Cause:**

1.  **Remaining Manual Steps:** The final usability hurdle is the startup process. The user must currently start three separate components manually:
    *   `dictation_service.py` (the main server)
    *   `type_watcher.ahk` (for typing text)
    *   `notification_watcher.ahk` (for displaying notifications)
    -   **Root Cause:** There is no single, unified script to launch and manage all required processes for the user.

**Verification Steps (How to Reproduce Success):**
1.  Run `notification_watcher.ahk` and `type_watcher.ahk`.
2.  In a Git-Bash terminal, run the server: `source .venv/Scripts/activate && DICTATION_SERVICE_STARTED_CORRECTLY="true" python dictation_service.py`
3.  In a second terminal, trigger dictation: `touch C:/tmp/vosk_trigger`
4.  **Observe:** The "Listening" notification appears, the transcribed and corrected text is typed into the active window, and a final notification confirms the process. The entire chain works as designed.

**Developer's Follow-up Actions:**

1.  **Priority 1: Create a Master Startup Script.** The final task is to create a single, user-friendly script (e.g., `start_all_windows.cmd` or an AHK script) that reliably launches the Python server and both AHK watcher scripts in the background.
2.  **Documentation:** Update the main `README.md` with the new, simplified startup instructions for Windows users.
