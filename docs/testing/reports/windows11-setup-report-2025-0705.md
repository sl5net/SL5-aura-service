### **STT Project - Windows 11 Application Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 5, 2025

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Windows 11 Pro
- **Platform:** Running in VirtualBox

**Outcome:** **PARTIAL SUCCESS** (Core application runs, final integration step fails)

**Summary:**

Following the successful setup, we conducted the first operational test of the `dictation_service.py` on Windows. Significant progress was made by refactoring the Python script to be platform-aware. The script now correctly uses a file polling mechanism on Windows instead of the Linux-specific `inotify`, and successfully starts the LanguageTool server by setting the correct working directory.

A new command-line argument `--test-text` was introduced, which proved invaluable for testing the processing chain without a microphone.

**Identified Issues & Root Cause:**

1.  **Initial Failure:** The script first failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vosk'`, indicating that the Python requirements were not installed in the virtual environment. This was resolved by manually running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  **Main Failure:** The request to the LanguageTool server results in a `Read timed out` error after 10 seconds.
    -   **Root Cause:** The VirtualBox environment is significantly slower than a native machine. The LanguageTool server, while running, is too resource-intensive to respond within the default 10-second timeout. The Windows Firewall was ruled out as a cause.

**Verification Steps (How to Reproduce):**
1.  Ensure `type_watcher.ahk` is running.
2.  In a Git-Bash terminal, activate the virtual environment and run the server:
    ```bash
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    DICTATION_SERVICE_STARTED_CORRECTLY="true" python dictation_service.py --test-text "dies ist ein test"
    ```
3.  In a second terminal, create the trigger file: `touch C:/tmp/vosk_trigger`
4.  **Observe:** The application logs the timeout error. The **original**, uncorrected text is then written to the output file and typed.

**Developer's Follow-up Actions:**

1.  **Immediate Fix:** Increase the request `timeout` in the `correct_text` function within `dictation_service.py` (e.g., to 30 seconds) to accommodate the slower VM environment.
2.  **Verify Installer:** Review `windows11_setup.ps1` to confirm that the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command is executed correctly within the virtual environment, as this step had to be performed manually.
3.  **Documentation:** Add the new `--test-text` feature to the project's `README.md` as a valid method for debugging and testing.
4.  **Final Test:** After implementing the fixes, conduct a full end-to-end test using the AHK start scripts to confirm full functionality.
