### **STT Project - Manjaro Setup Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 3, 2025

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Manjaro Linux with KDE Plasma
- **ISO Used:** `manjaro-kde-25.0.4-minimal-250623-linux612.iso`
- **Platform:** Running as a guest in VirtualBox.

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

**Summary:**

The setup process for the STT application was tested on a fresh Manjaro Linux virtual machine and confirmed to be fully functional.

The `manjaro_arch_setup.sh` script successfully installed all required system dependencies (from `pacman`) and Python packages. All external models and tools were downloaded and configured correctly. The application starts, loads the models, and performs end-to-end audio transcription as expected.

**Key Findings:**

-   The system successfully records audio, transcribes it, and outputs the resulting text via `xdotool`.
-   The test was completed using only the project's provided scripts.
-   No external macro utilities (e.g., `autokey`) were required for functionality.
### **STT Project - Manjaro Setup Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 4, 2025

**Environment:**
-   **Distribution:** Manjaro Linux with KDE Plasma
-   **ISO Used:** `manjaro-kde-25.0.4-minimal-250623-linux612.iso`
-   **Platform:** Running as a guest in VirtualBox.

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

**Summary:**

The significantly improved `manjaro_arch_setup.sh` was tested on both a fresh Manjaro VM and an existing installation. The script is now fully automated, robust, and user-friendly, successfully setting up the entire application for end-to-end transcription in both scenarios.

**Key Findings:**

-   **Intelligent Dependency Handling:** The script correctly identifies a pre-existing, compatible Java installation (version >=17) and skips the setup, preventing conflicts.
-   **Idempotency:** The script runs successfully on a system where the application is already installed, without causing errors.
-   **Location-Independent:** The script can be executed from any directory and still correctly locates the project root.
-   **End-to-End Functionality:** The setup process, from dependency installation to model download, completes successfully, resulting in a fully working application.

The complete setup process for the STT application on a fresh Ubuntu virtual machine was tested and confirmed to be fully functional.

All required system dependencies, Python packages, and external models were successfully installed using the project's setup scripts. The application starts correctly and performs end-to-end audio transcription.

**Key Findings:**

-   The system successfully records audio, transcribes it, and outputs the resulting text as expected.
-   The test was completed using only the project's provided scripts.
-   No external macro utilities (e.g., `autokey`) were required for functionality.

### **STT Project - Windows 11 Setup Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 5, 2024

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Windows 11 Pro
- **Platform:** Running in VirtualBox

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

**Summary:**

The `windows11_setup.ps1` script was tested on a fresh Windows 11 virtual machine. In its original state, the script failed due to multiple syntax and logic errors specific to the PowerShell environment. After a series of targeted corrections, the setup script was able to run to completion, successfully installing all system dependencies (Java, Python), Python packages, and downloading all required external models and tools.

While the **setup is now functional**, the application itself remains non-operational on Windows, as correctly noted by the script's final warning messages.


**Developer's Follow-up Actions:**

As per the script's warnings, the following core application components need to be re-implemented for Windows compatibility:
*   **File Trigger:** Replace `inotify-tools` with a Windows-native solution (e.g., PowerShell's `FileSystemWatcher` or Python's `watchdog` library).
*   **Text Typing:** Replace `xdotool` with a cross-platform or Windows-native solution (e.g., Python's `pyautogui` library).
*   **Audio:** Note the potential need for manual PortAudio installation for users.

### **STT Project - Windows 11 Application Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 5, 2025

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Windows 11 Pro
- **Platform:** Running in VirtualBox

**Outcome:** **PARTIAL SUCCESS** (Core application runs, final integration step fails)

**Summary:**

Following the successful setup, we conducted the first operational test of the `dictation_service.py` on Windows. Significant progress was made by refactoring the Python script to be platform-aware. The script now correctly uses a file polling mechanism on Windows instead of the Linux-specific `inotify`, and successfully starts the LanguageTool server by setting the correct working directory.

A new command-line argument `--test-text` was introduced, which proved invaluable for testing the processing chain without a microphone.

**Identified Issues & Root Cause:**

1.  **Initial Failure:** The script first failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vosk'`, indicating that the Python requirements were not installed in the virtual environment. This was resolved by manually running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  **Main Failure:** The request to the LanguageTool server results in a `Read timed out` error after 10 seconds.
    -   **Root Cause:** The VirtualBox environment is significantly slower than a native machine. The LanguageTool server, while running, is too resource-intensive to respond within the default 10-second timeout. The Windows Firewall was ruled out as a cause.

**Verification Steps (How to Reproduce):**
1.  Ensure `type_watcher.ahk` is running.
2.  In a Git-Bash terminal, activate the virtual environment and run the server:
    ```bash
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    DICTATION_SERVICE_STARTED_CORRECTLY="true" python dictation_service.py --test-text "dies ist ein test"
    ```
3.  In a second terminal, create the trigger file: `touch C:/tmp/vosk_trigger`
4.  **Observe:** The application logs the timeout error. The **original**, uncorrected text is then written to the output file and typed.

**Developer's Follow-up Actions:**

1.  **Immediate Fix:** Increase the request `timeout` in the `correct_text` function within `dictation_service.py` (e.g., to 30 seconds) to accommodate the slower VM environment.
2.  **Verify Installer:** Review `windows11_setup.ps1` to confirm that the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command is executed correctly within the virtual environment, as this step had to be performed manually.
3.  **Documentation:** Add the new `--test-text` feature to the project's `README.md` as a valid method for debugging and testing.
4.  **Final Test:** After implementing the fixes, conduct a full end-to-end test using the AHK start scripts to confirm full functionality.
### **STT Project - Windows 11 Application Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 6, 2025

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Windows 11 Pro
- **Platform:** Running in VirtualBox

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS (Manual Script Start Required)**

**Summary:**

This test confirms that all issues identified in the previous report (`...0705.md`) have been successfully resolved. The `windows11_setup.ps1` installer now correctly installs all Python dependencies. 

Furthermore, a platform-aware notification system for Windows has been implemented using a dedicated `notification_watcher.ahk` script, providing essential user feedback. The core application is now **fully functional end-to-end** on Windows.

**Identified Issue & Root Cause:**

1.  **Remaining Manual Steps:** The final usability hurdle is the startup process. The user must currently start three separate components manually:
    *   `dictation_service.py` (the main server)
    *   `type_watcher.ahk` (for typing text)
    *   `notification_watcher.ahk` (for displaying notifications)
    -   **Root Cause:** There is no single, unified script to launch and manage all required processes for the user.

**Verification Steps (How to Reproduce Success):**
1.  Run `notification_watcher.ahk` and `type_watcher.ahk`.
2.  In a Git-Bash terminal, run the server: `source .venv/Scripts/activate && DICTATION_SERVICE_STARTED_CORRECTLY="true" python dictation_service.py`
3.  In a second terminal, trigger dictation: `touch C:/tmp/vosk_trigger`
4.  **Observe:** The "Listening" notification appears, the transcribed and corrected text is typed into the active window, and a final notification confirms the process. The entire chain works as designed.

**Developer's Follow-up Actions:**

1.  **Priority 1: Create a Master Startup Script.** The final task is to create a single, user-friendly script (e.g., `start_all_windows.cmd` or an AHK script) that reliably launches the Python server and both AHK watcher scripts in the background.
2.  **Documentation:** Update the main `README.md` with the new, simplified startup instructions for Windows users.
