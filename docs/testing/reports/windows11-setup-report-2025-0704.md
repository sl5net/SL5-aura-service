### **STT Project - Windows 11 Setup Test Report**

**Test Date:** July 5, 2024

**Environment:**
- **Distribution:** Windows 11 Pro
- **Platform:** Running in VirtualBox

**Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

**Summary:**

The `windows11_setup.ps1` script was tested on a fresh Windows 11 virtual machine. In its original state, the script failed due to multiple syntax and logic errors specific to the PowerShell environment. After a series of targeted corrections, the setup script was able to run to completion, successfully installing all system dependencies (Java, Python), Python packages, and downloading all required external models and tools.

While the **setup is now functional**, the application itself remains non-operational on Windows, as correctly noted by the script's final warning messages.


**Developer's Follow-up Actions:**

As per the script's warnings, the following core application components need to be re-implemented for Windows compatibility:
*   **File Trigger:** Replace `inotify-tools` with a Windows-native solution (e.g., PowerShell's `FileSystemWatcher` or Python's `watchdog` library).
*   **Text Typing:** Replace `xdotool` with a cross-platform or Windows-native solution (e.g., Python's `pyautogui` library).
*   **Audio:** Note the potential need for manual PortAudio installation for users.
